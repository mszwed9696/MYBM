              Because they can't deliver it. They're optimized for collecting retainers, not driving revenue. We're different. Here's exactly why we can guarantee results when everyone else hides behind "effort-based" contracts.

              The Marketing Industry's Dirty Secret
            </h2>

            <p>
              Most marketing agencies have zero accountability to results. They charge $5k-$20k monthly retainers whether your revenue grows or not.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">Here's their playbook:</p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>"We'll provide X hours of service monthly"</strong> → No mention of revenue impact</li>
              <li><strong>"We'll deliver Y leads/impressions/clicks"</strong> → Vanity metrics, not revenue</li>
              <li><strong>"Results take time, marketing is a long-term investment"</strong> → Translation: We're not confident we can move the needle</li>
              <li><strong>"Success depends on many factors outside our control"</strong> → Pre-emptive excuse for failure</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold">
              They're selling effort, not outcomes. And effort doesn't pay your bills—revenue does.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              Why We Can Guarantee 30% Growth
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Reason #1: We Only Work With Qualified Businesses</h3>

            <p>
              We don't work with everyone who can pay. We turn down 90% of applicants. Our minimum criteria:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>$100k+ monthly revenue:</strong> Proven business model, existing customer base</li>
              <li><strong>Product-market fit established:</strong> You know your offer converts, you just need more customers</li>
              <li><strong>Ready to scale infrastructure:</strong> Team/operations can handle 30%+ growth</li>
              <li><strong>Marketing budget available:</strong> $5k-$20k+ monthly for ads, tools, execution</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold">
              We don't guarantee results for startups with unproven offers or businesses without revenue history. We scale what already works.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Reason #2: We've Done This Before (Many Times)</h3>

            <p>
              100% of our clients exceed the 30% guarantee. Not 80%. Not 90%. 100%.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why? Because we've scaled 50+ businesses in your exact situation. We know what works. We're not experimenting on your dime—we're executing proven playbooks.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-newspaper-cream border-3 border-black p-8 my-8">
              <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mb-4">Our Track Record:</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Average growth:</strong> 87% revenue increase in year 1</li>
                <li><strong>Success rate:</strong> 100% hit or exceed 30% guarantee</li>
                <li><strong>Total revenue added:</strong> $18M+ for client businesses</li>
                <li><strong>Industries served:</strong> Coaching, consulting, courses, SaaS, B2B services</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Reason #3: We Build Systems, Not Run Campaigns</h3>

            <p>
              Most agencies run campaigns: Launch Facebook ads, hope they work, adjust if they don't.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              We build revenue systems that compound over time:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Evergreen acquisition funnels</strong> that convert 24/7 (not one-time campaigns)</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-channel traffic strategies</strong> (paid + organic + partnerships)</li>
              <li><strong>Automated nurture sequences</strong> that convert cold leads over weeks/months</li>
              <li><strong>Backend monetization</strong> increasing LTV through upsells/cross-sells</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Systems compound. Campaigns don't. That's why we can predict outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Reason #4: We Have Skin In The Game</h3>

            <p>
              If we don't hit 30% by month 12, we continue working at $0 monthly fees until you do.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Think about that: If we fail, we work for free. If traditional agencies fail, they still collect their retainer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our entire business model depends on your success. Incentives perfectly aligned.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              How The Guarantee Actually Works
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Establish Your Baseline</h3>

            <p>
              We calculate your average monthly revenue over the last 90 days. That's your baseline.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">Example:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>Month 1: $95k</li>
              <li>Month 2: $105k</li>
              <li>Month 3: $100k</li>
              <li><strong>Baseline: $100k/month</strong></li>
              <li><strong>30% Target: $130k/month by month 12</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Build & Execute Growth Systems</h3>

            <p>
              We spend months 1-3 diagnosing, strategizing, and building your revenue infrastructure:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>Audit current marketing, identify what's broken</li>
              <li>Build evergreen funnels (VSLs, webinars, application funnels)</li>
              <li>Launch paid traffic campaigns (Facebook, Google, YouTube)</li>
              <li>Implement email automation and nurture sequences</li>
              <li>Optimize conversion rates across every touchpoint</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Measure At 6 & 12 Months</h3>

            <p>
              We check progress at month 6 and month 12 against verified financial documentation.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">Month 6 Checkpoint:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>Are we on track for 30%+ by month 12?</li>
              <li>What's working? What needs adjustment?</li>
              <li>Do we need to double down or pivot?</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold mt-4">Month 12 Final Measurement:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>Did you hit 30%+ net revenue growth?</li>
              <li>If yes: Celebrate and plan next phase of growth</li>
              <li>If no: We work for $0 fees until you do (this has never happened)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              What's NOT Covered By The Guarantee
            </h2>

            <p>
              The guarantee covers our service fees. It does not cover:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Ad spend:</strong> You still pay platforms (Facebook, Google, etc.) for advertising</li>
              <li><strong>Tools/software:</strong> CRM, email platform, funnel builders, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>Third-party services:</strong> Designers, copywriters, developers if needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold">
              If we don't hit 30%, you pay $0 for our work but still cover pass-through costs (ads, tools). Fair deal.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              Why Other Agencies Won't Do This
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Can't Predict Outcomes</h3>

            <p>
              Most agencies run generic tactics across all clients. They don't have vertical-specific expertise or proven playbooks. They're guessing, which means they can't guarantee anything.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Don't Want The Risk</h3>

            <p>
              Guarantees mean accountability. If they fail, they lose money. Much safer to charge retainers regardless of results.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Work With Anyone Who Pays</h3>

            <p>
              Agencies take any client who can afford the retainer. We're selective—we only work with businesses we know we can scale. That's how we maintain 100% success rate.
            </p>

              The Bottom Line
            </h2>

            <p className="text-xl font-bold">
              Guarantees separate confidence from bullshit.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Any agency can promise results. We're the only ones willing to work for free if we don't deliver them.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your current marketing partner won't guarantee revenue growth, ask yourself why. Either they don't believe in their work, or they know their tactics don't reliably move the needle.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              We guarantee 30% because we've done it 50+ times. We know what works. And if we're wrong (we won't be), we'll keep working until we're right—at no cost to you.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              That's what real accountability looks like. Everything else is just marketing theater.
