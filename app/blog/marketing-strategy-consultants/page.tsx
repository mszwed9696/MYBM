              You've paid $25k-$50k for a marketing strategy consultant. They delivered a beautiful 60-page PowerPoint deck. Six months later, your revenue is unchanged. Sound familiar?
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              95% of marketing strategy consultants are glorified report writers. They analyze, they strategize, they present—and then they disappear. You're left holding a plan you don't know how to execute.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's the truth: Strategy without execution is worthless. And most consultants stop at strategy because execution is hard, messy, and accountable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's break down what separates consultants who drive revenue from consultants who deliver expensive paperwork.

              The Consultant Trap: Why Most Fail
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Sell Strategy, Not Results</h3>

            <p>
              Traditional consultants bill for hours spent analyzing and presenting. Once the deck is delivered, their job is done. Whether you implement it, whether it works—not their problem.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              If a consultant isn't measured on your revenue growth, they're incentivized to sell you more analysis, not more results.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Don't Execute</h3>

            <p>
              You hire a consultant, they build you a "comprehensive marketing strategy," and then hand you a 60-page plan that says:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>"Launch paid acquisition campaigns on Facebook and Google"</li>
              <li>"Build content marketing funnel targeting high-intent keywords"</li>
              <li>"Implement marketing automation and lead nurturing sequences"</li>
              <li>"Optimize conversion rates across landing pages"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Great. Now what? <strong>You still need someone to actually do all of that.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Most businesses don't have the internal team to execute. So the strategy sits on a shelf, and six months later you're back at square one.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Use Generic Frameworks</h3>

            <p>
              Here's how most consultants work:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>They run the same "diagnostic" they run for every client</li>
              <li>They plug your data into their templated frameworks</li>
              <li>They give you the same recommendations they gave the last 10 clients</li>
              <li>They brand it as "customized strategy" and charge $30k-$50k</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold">
              If your consultant's strategy looks like every other B2B SaaS strategy on the internet, you overpaid.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">They Have No Skin In The Game</h3>

            <p>
              Most consultants charge flat fees or hourly rates. Whether their strategy works or not, they get paid the same.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>No risk. No accountability. No reason to care if you actually grow.</strong>
            </p>

              What Actually Works: The 5 Criteria
            </h2>

            <p>
              If you're hiring a marketing strategy consultant, here's what to demand:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">1. They Must Execute, Not Just Strategize</h3>

            <p>
              A real consultant doesn't hand you a plan and walk away. They build it, launch it, and optimize it with you.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Ask: "After you deliver the strategy, who's implementing it?"
            </p>

            <p>
              If the answer is "you'll need to hire an agency or internal team for that," run. You're about to pay for a plan that won't get executed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Good consultants guide execution.</strong> They don't do all the grunt work, but they're in the weeds with you—setting up campaigns, reviewing creatives, optimizing funnels, managing agencies.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">2. They Must Be Measured On Revenue, Not Deliverables</h3>

            <p>
              If your consultant's success metric is "delivered comprehensive marketing strategy," you're getting screwed.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              The only metric that matters is revenue growth. Everything else is vanity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ask: "What revenue growth can you commit to, and what happens if we don't hit it?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Good consultants tie their compensation to results. Whether that's performance bonuses, revenue share, or guarantees—they have skin in the game.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">3. They Must Have Vertical-Specific Expertise</h3>

            <p>
              Marketing a $10k/month B2B consulting service is completely different from marketing a $47/month SaaS product. If your consultant treats them the same, they don't know what they're doing.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Ask: "How many businesses in my vertical have you scaled, and what were the results?"
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't want someone who's "done marketing for 15 years." You want someone who's scaled 10+ businesses exactly like yours.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">4. They Must Build Systems, Not Run Campaigns</h3>

            <p>
              Bad consultants launch campaigns. Good consultants build revenue systems that compound over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Campaign thinking:</strong> "Let's run Facebook ads to a webinar."</li>
              <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> "Let's build an evergreen acquisition engine that captures cold traffic, nurtures them through automated sequences, converts them on VSL funnels, and upsells them into backend offers—predictably and profitably."</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Systems scale. Campaigns don't.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">5. They Must Bring Outside Perspective</h3>

            <p>
              You're hiring a consultant because you're too close to your own business. If they just ask you what you want to do and write it down in a fancy deck, they're useless.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Good consultants challenge your assumptions, tell you what you're doing wrong, and bring strategies from outside your industry.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              Red Flags: When To Walk Away
            </h2>

            <p>
              Here are the warning signs that a consultant will waste your money:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">🚩 They Can't Show You Case Studies In Your Vertical</h3>

            <p>
              If they say "we've worked with hundreds of businesses across all industries," that means they're generalists who don't deeply understand your market.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              You want someone who's scaled 5-10 businesses exactly like yours, not someone who's "done marketing" for 500 random clients.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">🚩 They Charge Flat Fees With No Performance Incentive</h3>

            <p>
              If they're charging $30k-$50k for a strategy with no accountability to results, they're not confident in their work.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Real consultants tie their fees to performance. If they won't, it's because they know their strategies don't work.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">🚩 They Lead With "Discovery" And "Analysis"</h3>

            <p>
              Consultants love to sell "discovery phases" because it's billable time with zero accountability.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Translation:</strong> "We're going to spend 4-6 weeks interviewing your team, analyzing your data, and researching your market—and then we'll tell you what you probably already know."
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Good consultants diagnose fast and move to execution. Weeks of "discovery" is a stalling tactic.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">🚩 They Talk About "Brand" And "Positioning" But Not Revenue</h3>

            <p>
              If a consultant spends the first 30 minutes of your call talking about brand strategy, thought leadership, and market positioning—but hasn't mentioned revenue growth once—run.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Strategy consultants love abstract concepts because they're impossible to measure. Revenue growth is concrete. Demand concrete.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">🚩 They Don't Ask Tough Questions About Your Offer</h3>

            <p>
              A real consultant will ask:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
              <li>"What's your LTV and CAC?"</li>
              <li>"What's your current close rate and sales cycle?"</li>
              <li>"How much can you spend to acquire a customer?"</li>
              <li>"What have you tried that failed, and why did it fail?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If they just nod along and say "yeah we can help with that," they're order-takers, not strategists.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              What Good Consultants Actually Deliver
            </h2>

            <p>
              Here's what you should expect from a marketing strategy consultant who actually drives results:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">1. Rapid Diagnostic (1-2 Weeks)</h3>

            <p>
              They audit your current marketing, identify what's working and what's broken, and present a clear diagnosis with prioritized fixes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Not a 60-page deck.</strong> A short, actionable document that says "here's what's wrong, here's what to fix first, here's the expected impact."
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">2. Revenue-Focused Strategy (Week 3-4)</h3>

            <p>
              They build a 90-day roadmap with specific tactics, expected costs, and projected revenue impact.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Good strategy is specific: "Launch Facebook VSL funnel targeting [audience] with [$X] budget, expecting [Y] cost per acquisition and [Z] monthly revenue by day 60."
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">3. Execution Guidance (Ongoing)</h3>

            <p>
              They don't disappear after delivering the plan. They're in weekly calls, reviewing performance, optimizing campaigns, troubleshooting what's not working.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>They're in the weeds with you, not observing from 30,000 feet.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">4. Systems That Outlast Them</h3>

            <p>
              When they leave, you should have documented systems, trained team members, and infrastructure that keeps running without them.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              If you can't operate without them, they built dependency, not leverage.

              How To Evaluate Consultants: The Interview Questions
            </h2>

            <p>
              When vetting marketing strategy consultants, ask these questions:
            </p>

            <div className="bg-newspaper-cream border-3 border-black p-8 my-8">
              <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-3">The Essential Questions:</h3>

              <ul className="space-y-4">
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-headline uppercase text-sm">1. Results Question:</strong><br/>
                  "Show me 3 businesses in my vertical you've scaled. What was their starting revenue, ending revenue, and timeline?"

                <li>
                  <strong className="font-headline uppercase text-sm">2. Accountability Question:</strong><br/>
                  "What revenue growth can you guarantee, and what happens if we don't hit it?"

                <li>
                  <strong className="font-headline uppercase text-sm">3. Execution Question:</strong><br/>
                  "After you deliver the strategy, who's responsible for implementing it? How involved are you in execution?"
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-headline uppercase text-sm">4. Specificity Question:</strong><br/>
                  "Based on our 15-minute conversation, what's the first thing you'd change and why?"
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong className="font-headline uppercase text-sm">5. Systems Question:</strong><br/>
                  "What systems will you build that continue generating revenue after our engagement ends?"
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p className="font-bold">

              Pricing: What To Expect
            </h2>

            <p>
              Marketing strategy consultants typically charge in one of three ways:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Option 1: Project-Based ($25k-$75k)</h3>

            <p>
              Flat fee for strategy development. High upfront cost, zero accountability to results. This is how most consultants operate—and why most strategies fail.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Our take: Avoid unless they offer performance guarantees.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Option 2: Monthly Retainer ($8k-$25k/month)</h3>

            <p>
              Ongoing engagement where the consultant provides strategy + execution oversight. Better than project-based because they stick around to see results.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Our take: Good option if they tie fees to performance milestones.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-headline text-xl font-bold uppercase mt-8 mb-4">Option 3: Performance-Based (Base + % Revenue Growth)</h3>

            <p>
              Lower monthly retainer ($5k-$15k) plus percentage of revenue growth they generate. Consultant has real skin in the game.
            </p>

            <p className="font-bold">
              Our take: This is what we do. If a consultant won't do this, they don't believe in their work.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-black uppercase mt-12 mb-6 border-b-2 border-black pb-2">
              The Bottom Line
            </h2>

            <p className="text-xl font-bold">
              Stop paying for PowerPoints. Demand execution and accountability.

            <p>
              The difference between good and bad marketing consultants is simple:
            </p>

              If your consultant isn't willing to guarantee revenue growth, they're selling hope, not results.

              We guarantee 30% revenue growth minimum. If we don't hit it, we work for free until we do. That's what accountability looks like.
